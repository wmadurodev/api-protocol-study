# Requirements for parallel_perf_test.py
# Parallel Performance Testing Script for REST vs gRPC

# gRPC support
grpcio==1.60.0
grpcio-tools==1.60.0

# HTTP requests for REST API
requests==2.31.0

# Note: The script also requires the generated gRPC Python code
# from the python-grpc-client/ directory. Ensure you have run:
#   cd ../python-grpc-client
#   ./generate_grpc.sh
# or manually generated the protobuf files with protoc
